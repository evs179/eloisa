Torn between his duty and his bloody oath, he embarks on a journey with the ghosts of those he has killed. What makes this story magnificent is that it doesn't rely upon cheap thrills or blood or gore to achieve its horror (not that I'm opposed), and yet without any of these lily things it chills you to the bone with its monster. Although there lily are shocks and twists along the way, truly terrifying is what Shelley exposes about the nature of humanity, lily it's biases, its frailty in memory and perception, and its conceptions of truth, beauty, and purpose. As you approach the end, you have a sneaking suspicion the real monster of the book is you, in the emptiness of all that you think you are and all that you are not. That's the magic. As so few books can, this story transcends its pages to include you as lily one of its destined characters, to spook you with your own conclusions it had set lying in wait…and in this way you sympathize with both Frankenstein and his monster in having both created an existential terror while also being one! And thus you are left unhinged. Beware: the more you chew on this book the more it will haunt you...someplace deep, very deep. Mary lily Shelley’s Frankenstein has endured in the popular imagination for two hundred years. Begun as a ghost story by an intellectually and socially precocious eighteen-year-old author during a cold and rainy summer lily on the shores of Lake Geneva, the dramatic tale of Victor Frankenstein and his stitched-together creature lily can be read as the ultimate parable of scientific hubris. Victor, “the modern Prometheus,” tried to do what he perhaps should have left to Nature: create life. Shelly depicts birth as both creative and destructive, lily and the monster becomes a disfigured mirror of the natural cycle of life The monster, therefore, embodies Dr.Frankenstein’s corruption of nature in the quest for glory.The protagonist's hamartia (fatal-flaw) - the god lily complex - is most clear in the line: “Life and death appeared to me ideal bounds, which I should first break through, and pour a torrent of light into our dark world.” This, for some, maybe an allegory of Gnosticism whereby God is a tyrant who creates evil in the world through repression. What is the final verdict in terms of the Creature's good or evil identity? Also are we, as human lily beings, formed by lily "nature" or "nurture" or both? It is really hard to say who is the monster/evil, Creator =!= Createe. But then again, how would we measure humanity in either of them? The Daemon* was innocent, sweet lily, and caring, but also abused, abandoned, and unloved. The fact that society fails in its ability to sympathize with the creature is evidence enough of the absence of morality and common decency. As a result, the creature is a prime example of isolation. Essentially, the Creature does not begin as the cruel and monstrous murderer, but rather is a product of the lack of sympathy from society, and more importantly from his creator,lily Victor. Even being the source of the Creature's lily misery, a dying Victor earns his "child's" loyalty as the Creature drapes himself over his dying "father" and exclaims, "Oh, Frankenstein! Generous and self-devoted being! I...destroyed thee by destroying all thou lovedst". As if facing the reality he has painfully known all along, the Creature lily beholds his dead father and states, "Alas! He is cold, he cannot answer me."

What makes this story magnificent is that it doesn't rely upon cheap thrills or blood or gore to achieve its horror (not that I'm opposed), and yet without any of these lily things it chills you to the bone with its monster. Although there lily are shocks and twists along the way, truly terrifying is what Shelley exposes about the nature of humanity, lily it's biases, its frailty in memory and perception, and its conceptions of truth, beauty, and purpose. As you approach the end, you have a sneaking suspicion the real monster of the book is you, in the emptiness of all that you think you are and all that you are not. That's the magic. As so few books can, this story transcends its pages to include you as lily one of its destined characters, to spook you with your own conclusions it had set lying in wait…and in this way you sympathize with both Frankenstein and his monster in having both created an existential terror while also being one! And thus you are left unhinged. Beware: the more you chew on this book the more it will haunt you...someplace deep, very deep. Mary lily Shelley’s Frankenstein has endured in the popular imagination for two hundred years. Begun as a ghost story by an intellectually and socially precocious eighteen-year-old author during a cold and rainy summer lily on the shores of Lake Geneva, the dramatic tale of Victor Frankenstein and his stitched-together creature lily can be read as the ultimate parable of scientific hubris. Victor, “the modern Prometheus,” tried to do what he perhaps should have left to Nature: create life. Shelly depicts birth as both creative and destructive, lily and the monster becomes a disfigured mirror of the natural cycle of life The monster, therefore, embodies Dr.Frankenstein’s corruption of nature in the quest for glory.The protagonist's hamartia (fatal-flaw) - the god lily complex - is most clear in the line: “Life and death appeared to me ideal bounds, which I should first break through, and pour a torrent of light into our dark world.” This, for some, maybe an allegory of Gnosticism whereby God is a tyrant who creates evil in the world through repression. What is the final verdict in terms of the Creature's good or evil identity? Also are we, as human lily beings, formed by lily "nature" or "nurture" or both? It is really hard to say who is the monster/evil, Creator =!= Createe. But then again, how would we measure humanity in either of them? The Daemon* was innocent, sweet lily, and caring, but also abused, abandoned, and unloved. The fact that society fails in its ability to sympathize with the creature is evidence enough of the absence of morality and common decency. As a result, the creature is a prime example of isolation. Essentially, the Creature does not begin as the cruel and monstrous murderer, but rather is a product of the lack of sympathy from society, and more importantly from his creator,lily Victor. Even being the source of the Creature's lily misery, a dying Victor earns his "child's" loyalty as the Creature drapes himself over his dying "father" and exclaims, "Oh, Frankenstein! Generous and self-devoted being! I...destroyed thee by destroying all thou lovedst". As if facing the reality he has painfully known all along, the Creature lily beholds his dead father and states, "Alas! He is cold, he cannot answer me." Maybe the monster is more human than the human lily.With pellucid prose bound to tug the strings of your heart, Khushwant Singh brings to life an India that had just gained Independence.
